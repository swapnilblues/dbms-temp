An application to buy book.


Hi guys, this is our git repo for the development.
Things to remember::

1. add to .gitignore file to ignore files not related to developement.
2. always use npm install --save to install any dev dependencies, donot install any dependencies without mentioning save.
3. lets start the first module. :::: 
 a.front end for login, 
 b.databse set for login,
 c.backend end point for login.
